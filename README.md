Use this template to create your notes.

Open the `template.tex` file and follow these three main steps:

   1. Edit the lecture title.
   2. Edit your name and the date.
   3. Rename `uni.tex` to match your uni (e.g., `jmh2045.tex`), edit the filename accordingly below, and put your notes in this file.

Then write your notes in the renamed `uni.tex` file.

If you're new to LaTeX, check out [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com), an online LaTeX environment where you can edit and render your documents.
They also have a very useful [getting started guide](http://www.overleaf.com/help/18-how-do-i-use-overleaf).
[Click here](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=http://jakehofman.com/tmp/template.zip) to use Overleaf to edit this template in your browser.

If you prefer writing in Markdown, you can do so and use [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to convert to LaTeX before submitting (e.g., `pandoc uni.md -o uni.tex`).
More on that [here](http://tech.lauritz.me/easy-latex-with-markdown-pandoc/).
