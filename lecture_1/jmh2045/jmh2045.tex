This is just so that you have an example of what the file structure should look like for submitted notes.

Notice that I've only added the main \texttt{template.tex} file and my \texttt{jmh2045.tex} file, along with any figures included in the document and the file rendered pdf, to the repository.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/example_figure.png}
    \caption{
      This is how to include a figure.
      As long as you use pdflatex most file types (e.g., jpg, png, pdf) should work.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
