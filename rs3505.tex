\section{Introduction}
     Data visualization is an important step in data science, with which we can present the abstract data to people in a more direct way. It can help us explain, study and find the information we want from the original raw data.
\section{What is data visualization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There can be many different definitions which emphasize on different perspective to describe data visualization
\item One of the definition is the use of computer generated entire representation of data to amplify commission 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Why create visualization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Record information\\
     Example: Medical devices in 19th century to measure blood pressure


\item Verify and support hypothesis\\
      Example:John Snow uses scatter plot to map of London to study the relationship between cholera and water use on Broad Road, which is the first natural experiment.Convinced other people about the hypothesis 
\item Inspire others\\Visulization as the artificial memory, extract data and make sense of it\\Example: Four sets of data in different patterns,but they can have the same mean value and same standard derivation 
\end{enumerate}
\section{Expository data analysis}
Example: John Tukey, the wikipedia popularity of him, and we can find that at some time points, the popularity becomes very high, so there can be some incident happen at this time point\\  On January 13th,2011, there is a very high peak--A question:What is software

\section{What is good visualization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Should be able to express whatever in your data nothing much, nothing more
\item Different visualization tools can express different kind of data\\Example: 1-D data cannot show correlation
\item One visualization can be more effective than another if you can express faster and more accurately\\Activity: Guess the area/length ratio\\Steven Power Law:
\begin{equation}
  \S=I^P
\end{equation}
Different shapes have different p, for example, length is the easiest to estimate and p~1\\
Experiments:\\1:5 charts, ask people to estimate the position on y axis in different bars\\2:Judge the ratio with two charts:bar and pie chart
\item 
Ranking of effectiveness: Position is the most effective>norminal/ordinal/quantitative

\end{enumerate}

\section{Color}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Color of charts can have some effects on the expression of data
\item Color mapping should also be somewhat linear and have a constant using measurement
\item Small changes in the colors should correspond to the linear perceptual changes in per section
\item Take care of color blind people
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tools}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a balance between speed to use and expressiveness
\item Declarative languages
\item Advantages and disadvantages of declarative languages\\difficult to debug,etc
\item Example: Population for some cities at different time
\item Do not give users a pie, give them how to make a pie
\end{enumerate}
